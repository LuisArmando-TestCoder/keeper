# Monotype Variable Font Demos
 
Monotype is pleased to introduce a series of demo variable fonts. These demo fonts were made to showcase the capabilities in the new OpenType version 1.8 specification. Please read the [EULA], which limits usage for development, prototyping and testing purposes â€“ and not for re-distribution or commercial use.

To test the functionality in these fonts, try [FontView].

We look forward to your feedback, as this will help shape the development of other variable fonts we have in the works. If you are interested in testing next steps in the evolution of digital type and typography, let us know [@Monotype] #VariableFonts
